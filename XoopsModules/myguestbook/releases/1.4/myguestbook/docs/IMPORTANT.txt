NARGA'S GUESTBOOK MODULES FOR XOOPS PORTAL 2.X
==============================================

	Myguestbook modules was rewrite after long time from the first release. I haven't enough free time to do it so I decide discontinue develope my project ! Sorry for this bad news. The best things I can do now is support for my work at http://www.nargalab.info/forum as long as I could.
	I have many ideas to do:
		>+Insert Search function
		>+Can turn-off Gender option
		>+Send email to admin when new entry signed
		+ Chose Nation and display as flag
		>+Local below the Time signing
		+ Add notification options so people can be notified if there are new messages
		+ Add the option to moderate messages
		+ Cutoff option to display # character per msg ( fix the display to large)
		>+auto fill the infomation if the submitter is member
		+ Add an RSS feed to show the latest messages
		+ Check for valid email or disable some email can sign in the guest book
		+ Can disable or enable all the guestbook's feature
		>+The Location field included in this version but it not work -_- sorry I will fix it soon when I make the country flag done ^_^
		The ">" sign means that feature was done, others may be I'll do it in future ! Thanks four your support again !
